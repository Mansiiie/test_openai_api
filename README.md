## Description

This project demonstrates how to interact with OpenAI's GPT models using Python and the OpenAI API. It includes examples of sending prompts, handling completions, and customizing responses using parameters like temperature, max tokens, and stop sequences.

The notebook is designed for anyone interested in experimenting with large language models programmatically. Whether you're building a chatbot, generating content, or just exploring the API's capabilities, this serves as a practical starting point.

Key features:
- Connects to the OpenAI API
- Sends user prompts and retrieves model responses
- Allows for parameter tuning to control output creativity and length
- Demonstrates basic error handling for API requests
